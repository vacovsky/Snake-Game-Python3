	Method 1) Double click snake_main.py.
	Method 2) Right click snake_main.py and choose open with Python (Do not open with IDLE).
	Method 3) Open IDLE and run launch_game_[idle].py

	Use the WASD keys to change direction and use X to quit.
	
	Your main goal is to collect as many pieces of fruit (The "@" pieces) as possible.
	
	Colliding with walls will not kill you but will instead move you to the opposite side of the screen.
